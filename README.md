# tree-sitter-fn

This is a tree-sitter grammar for Fn. I've included a syntax highlighting query
as queries/highlights.scm.

Fn is a programming language I am working on. It is a mixed-paradigm language
aiming to provide a fresh and modern take on the Lisp family of languages. Fn
prioritizes clarity, consistency, and efficiency. For more information, see
<http://github.com/jepugs/Fn>.

## Stability

Fn's syntax is not stable at this time. While I will try my best to keep this
gramar updated, this grammar may at times be out of sync with the current state
of Fn development.
